## Research

**Just breathe** is meant to be a mobile-first experience, focusing on accessibility and ease of us. No fireworks, no complex systems. As a long time meditation practicioner, when presented with a myriad of choices I often get flustered and irritated, which results in a disturbed practice. The goal of this excercise is to create a minimalist platform for all who get easily distracted.
