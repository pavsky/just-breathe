## Research

**Just breathe** is meant to be a mobile-first experience, focusing on accessibility and ease of use. No fireworks, no complex systems. As a long time meditation practicioner, when presented with a myriad of choices I often get flustered and irritated, which results in a disturbed practice. The goal of this excercise is to create a minimalist platform for all who get easily distracted. This has proven to be a key **paint point** for people I have consulted in this matter, thus providing me with a great opportunity to create this project.
